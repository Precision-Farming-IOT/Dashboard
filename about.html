        The hardware part includes embedded systems and software program is developed using the Arduino ide. 
        The sensors used are temperature and humidity sensor,  soil moisture sensor.
        Precision Farming seeks to use new technologies to increase crop yields and 
        profitability while lowering the levels of traditional inputs needed to grow crops.
         Farmers utilizing precision farming are using less to grow more,
         Sensors are needed to record observational data from the crops and/or soil in order to accomplish this (Observation). 
         The status of the crop or soil, as well as any deficiencies or needs (Diagnostics), 
         are determined on the basis of the sensor results using specific software with decision rules and models.
